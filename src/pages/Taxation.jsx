        Tax is an obligatory fee or other sort of levy that is levied by a
        government agency on a taxpayer (an individual or other legal entity) in
        order to pay for certain public expenses. Tax evasion, nonpayment, and
        resistance to taxation are all illegal and subject to punishment.
        Indirect taxes, such as the Goods and Services Tax or GST, and direct
        taxes, such as income tax, make up taxes. Therefore, it is crucial to
        follow tax regulations, make sure tax planning is done correctly, and
        file an income tax return. Strategies for tax planning are frequently
        used to assist businesses in achieving their financial and operational
        objectives. Both large and small businesses can benefit from tax
        planning, which is crucial for minimizing tax liabilities and ensuring
        that all applicable allowances, deductions, exclusions, and exemptions
        are combined in the most tax-effective way possible to lower the overall
        tax payment.
